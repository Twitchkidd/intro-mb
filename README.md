# Intro: Master Blaster!

Start by downloading VS Code! This is our text editor, so like Word for programming!

[Link To Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Please install these extensions! (The extensions tab is accessible as the bottom button on the top left, with the icon with the block coming off the other blocks!)

- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
- Live Share Extension Pack
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Python

Also copy what's in settings.json file in this repo into your settings.json! (Access settings.json by pressing Ctrl + ',' and then clicking the left-most button in the top right of the window with the icon that looks like a page being flipped around.)

Ehh, hold this thought, below: (SKIP)
[Install 'Git For Windows'](https://gitforwindows.org/) which is going to be where we're going to getting our terminal, and started with source control.

Maybe first we [try Windows Subsystem Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), see if that's an option. Windows 10? Might not be on previous versions, in which case go for the Git For Windows option.

Oh, wow, this is a really good article on making a pretty Windows shell, if we have 30 minutes, go through [this!](https://dev.to/dylantientcheu/transforming-your-ugly-windows-terminal-to-a-unicorn-577k)

So after you get the terminal running, back in VS Code hit Ctrl + Shift + 'p' to launch the 'command palette' and start typing shell, then hit enter on "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH", which makes opening files and folders in vscode very simple.

Actually, some of these are essential, it's just going to either go to .bash_profile or .zshrc, depending. (ACTUALLY)
Ehh, hold this thought, re: .bash_profile, (SKIP)
Then from the terminal, we'll learn how to navigate, make directories, files, and use nano, which we'll use to copy over the list of shortcuts in the .bash_profile file that make using the terminal easier.
