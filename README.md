# Intro: Master Blaster!

Start by downloading VS Code! This is our text editor, so like Word for programming!

[Link To Download](https://TODO.com)

Please install these extensions! (The extensions tab is accessible as the bottom button on the top left, with the icon with the block coming off the other blocks!)

- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Python

Also copy what's in settings.json in this repo into your settings.json! (Access settings.json by pressing Windows + , and then clicking the leftmost button in the top right with the icon that looks like a page being flipped around!)
